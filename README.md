## What It Does

It just logs your mood- It's in the name???

## How To Use

Open up the .lnk file on your desktop to get started. To log your mood, input the command `logmood` to log your mood.
Simply press your current mood on the chart, then close the GUI. From there, you can open up the shortcut and use the command `readlogs` to see mood history.
